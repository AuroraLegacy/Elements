			<p>The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:</p>
      <ul>
				<li>The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
				<li>The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals ld8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.</li>
				<li>The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.</li>
        <li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs-hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.</li>

		<description>
			<p>Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>
				<li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>
				<li>The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.</li>
				<li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.</p>
      <p>You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change the armor’s model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.</p>
      <p>You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Thunder Gauntlets.</strong> Each of the armor’s gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren’t holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Defensive Field.</strong> As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>
				<li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>
				<li>The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.</li>
				<li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.</p>
      <p>You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change the armor’s model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.</p>
      <p>You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Thunder Gauntlets.</strong> Each of the armor’s gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren’t holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Defensive Field.</strong> As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p class="indent">Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</p>
